                <p>Picture the smallest LEGO brick in the universe—then shrink it again. Stanford engineers have built 500 light-traps that are each only a few millionths of a meter wide, yet each one can gently grab a single particle of light, a photon, coming from a single atom. Line up enough of these traps, and you get not a toy castle but a quantum computer the size of a postage stamp that could someday crack codes or design new medicines in hours instead of millennia.</p>
                
                <p>The traps are called optical cavities: two mirrors facing each other so perfectly that a photon can bounce back and forth thousands of times before leaking out. By nestling individual atoms inside these mirrored pockets, the team forces the atoms to spit out their light in one direction, like a quarterback throwing a perfect spiral every time. Because the photons are identical in color, shape, and timing, they can be linked into "entangled" states—the fuel of quantum computation.</p>
                
                <h2>From Handful to Hundreds</h2>
                
                <p>Until now, even top-tier labs handled only a handful of such cavities. Graduate student Avik Dutt and colleagues etched 500 into a silicon chip using the same lithography tools that sculpt computer processors. Tiny pedestals raise the mirrors only 200 nanometers apart—so close that an atom placed inside feels the electromagnetic field amplified a thousand-fold. The result: 85 percent of the photons emerge in a single, programmable wave-packet, ready to be wired into a network.</p>
                
                <h2>The Path to a Million Qubits</h2>
                
                <p>A million-qubit machine—enough to run Shor's algorithm and factor the 2,048-bit numbers that guard today's internet—would need roughly 2,000 of these chips. The good news: the mirrors are stamped, not hand-polished. "We're already talking to foundries," says team leader Jelena Vučković. "This isn't a moon-shot anymore; it's a conveyor belt."</p>
                
                <p>In other words, the tunnel has light at the end—and every photon is identical, directed, and on-demand.</p>
