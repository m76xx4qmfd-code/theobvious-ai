            <div class="article-content">
                <p>When Dr. Mary Disis called the first volunteer in 2003, she rehearsed the worst-case script: "Metastatic breast cancer vaccines usually buy months, not years." Twenty-one birthdays later, that same volunteer — originally given 18 months to live — picked up the phone again.</p>
                
                <p>Every woman in the tiny Phase I trial is still alive, an outcome Disis calls "statistically absurd."</p>
                
                <p>The secret may be less about the cancer and more about memory — immunological memory, the kind your body keeps for measles but is thought to forget for tumors.</p>
                
                <h2>The Two Ingredients Everyone Else Missed</h2>
                
                <p>The original vaccine stitched together two ingredients most trials skip. First, a fragment of the cancer's HER2 protein, the bull's-eye on 20% of breast tumors. Second, an immune-boosting molecule originally designed for tuberculosis.</p>
                
                <p>That adjuvant doesn't just rev the engine; it builds a library.</p>
                
                <p>Biopsies taken last year show T cells still patrolling blood and bone with molecular wanted posters printed two decades earlier. In mouse work, removing those memory cells erased protection, proving the cells — not the drug — are the living therapy.</p>
                
                <h2>From Alarm Clock to Surveillance Camera</h2>
                
                <p>Why this matters: today's cancer vaccines act like short-lived alarm clocks, waking the immune system for a week then letting it doze off. The adjuvant combo here appears to turn the alarm into a permanent surveillance camera, continually reminding T cells that anything wearing HER2 is an imposter.</p>
                
                <p>If the mechanism holds for prostate, pancreas, or colon versions — now being planned — the "incurable" label could move from patients to their tumors.</p>
                
                <h2>The Catch</h2>
                
                <p>The trial enrolled only 66 women, all with low tumor burden. A 900-person study launches this fall, testing whether the same memory trick works when the cancer is already everywhere.</p>
                
                <p>If it does, oncologists may trade chemotherapy cycles for a shot and a booster, transforming metastatic cancer into a chronic disease you carry, but never die from.</p>
